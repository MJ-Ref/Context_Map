# .cursorrules — Context_Map Project

This is a **Context_Map** project — an agent-first repository template
that demonstrates every pattern it teaches.

## Where to Find Rules

This file exists for backward compatibility. The full rule set lives in
the modern MDC format:

- **Full Cursor rules:** `.cursor/rules/global.mdc`
- **Universal agent instructions:** `AGENTS.md`
- **System of record:** `docs/` (start at `docs/_INDEX.md`)
- **Execution plans:** `plans/_INDEX.md`

## Quick Constraints

1. `docs/` is the system of record — route there, never duplicate
2. `guide/` is read-only — never modify educational content
3. Update `<!-- reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD -->` on any doc you change
4. Run `scripts/check-structure.sh` before committing
5. Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`
