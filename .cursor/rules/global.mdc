# Context_Map — Cursor Agent Rules

> **Purpose:** Configuration and routing for Cursor AI sessions.
> Read this first, then follow the routing table to `docs/`.

## Project Overview

**Context_Map** is an agent-first repository template and guide. It demonstrates
the patterns it teaches. `docs/` is the system of record. All agent entry files
are routing tables — they point to docs, they never duplicate content.

## Routing Table

| I need to...                        | Go to                                  |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Understand the architecture         | `docs/architecture/OVERVIEW.md`        |
| Learn the dependency rules          | `docs/architecture/DEPENDENCY_RULES.md`|
| See non-negotiable principles       | `docs/golden-rules/PRINCIPLES.md`      |
| Follow coding standards             | `docs/golden-rules/CODING_STANDARDS.md`|
| Check quality scorecard             | `docs/quality/QUALITY_SCORECARD.md`    |
| Review tech debt                    | `docs/quality/TECH_DEBT_REGISTER.md`   |
| Follow development workflow         | `docs/workflows/DEVELOPMENT.md`        |
| Review a PR                         | `docs/workflows/PR_REVIEW.md`          |
| Write or run tests                  | `docs/workflows/TESTING.md`            |
| Update documentation                | `docs/workflows/DOC_GARDENING.md`      |
| Get onboarded as a new agent        | `docs/agent-guide/ONBOARDING.md`       |
| Do common tasks                     | `docs/agent-guide/COMMON_TASKS.md`     |
| Hand off a session                  | `docs/session/SESSION_HANDOFF.md`      |
| Find all docs (master index)        | `docs/_INDEX.md`                       |
| Create or review an execution plan  | `plans/_INDEX.md`                      |
| Record an architecture decision     | `docs/architecture/ADR/000-template.md`|

## Key Rules

1. **`docs/` is the system of record.** All operational truth lives there. Never
   duplicate content into agent entry files or code comments.
2. **`guide/` is read-only.** It explains the patterns. Never modify it.
3. **`plans/` are temporal.** They move from `active/` to `completed/`. Docs are evergreen.
4. **Update freshness dates** when you modify any doc: `<!-- reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD -->`.
5. **Run validation** before committing: `scripts/check-structure.sh` and
   `scripts/check-agent-files.sh`.
6. **Record architectural decisions** in `docs/architecture/ADR/` using the template.

## Session Protocol

1. **Start:** Read `docs/session/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` for prior context
2. **Work:** Follow `docs/workflows/DEVELOPMENT.md` for all changes
3. **Quality:** Check work against `docs/quality/QUALITY_SCORECARD.md`
4. **End:** Update `docs/session/SESSION_HANDOFF.md` before closing

## Commit Conventions

- Use conventional commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `test:`
- Run `scripts/check-structure.sh` before committing
- Update `<!-- reviewed: YYYY-MM-DD -->` tags on any modified docs

## File Conventions

- Markdown for all documentation
- Kebab-case for directories, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for doc filenames
- Every doc starts with an H1 heading and a purpose blockquote
- Tables for navigation, not prose
