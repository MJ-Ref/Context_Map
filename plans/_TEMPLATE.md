## Objective

**What:** [One sentence describing the deliverable.]

**Why:** [One sentence explaining the motivation — what problem does this solve or what value does it create?]

## Context

**Background:** [What led to this plan? What existing state are we working from?]

- [Constraint 1 — e.g., must not break existing API]
- [Constraint 2 — e.g., must complete before dependency X ships]

**Dependencies:**
- [Dependency 1 — e.g., requires PLAN-YYY to be completed first]
- [Dependency 2 — e.g., depends on docs/architecture/OVERVIEW.md being current]

## Approach

[High-level strategy in 2-4 sentences. Describe the overall method — not the individual steps, but the shape of the work. Why this approach over alternatives?]

## Phases / Steps

### Phase 1: [Phase Name]

- [ ] **Step 1.1:** [Description of the step]
  - *Acceptance:* [How do we know this step is done?]
- [ ] **Step 1.2:** [Description of the step]
  - *Acceptance:* [How do we know this step is done?]

### Phase 2: [Phase Name]

| [What could go wrong?] | Low / Medium / High | Low / Medium / High | [How we prevent or respond to it] |
| [Second risk] | Low / Medium / High | Low / Medium / High | [Mitigation strategy] |

## Success Criteria

- [ ] [Measurable outcome 1 — e.g., all validation scripts pass]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 2 — e.g., docs/_INDEX.md updated with new entries]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 3 — e.g., no regressions in existing tests]
